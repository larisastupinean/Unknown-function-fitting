# Unknown-function-fitting
System identification using linear regression

This team project focuses on using a polynomial approximator for fitting an unknown two variable function and choosing the degree of the polynomial which yields the best
approximation. The identification of the function is done on the training data set, and the validation of the developed model is done on a separate data set generated by 
the same unknown function. These 2 data sets can be found in the MATLAB Data file "proj_fit_04.mat". The best model is the one which leads to the smallest mean squared error 
on the validation data. Here are some figures with the true values and the approximated values (obtained using the developed model) of the identification and validation output:
